## Map

- `Areas` areas are unique locations that group rooms together
- `Level` levels are Z-Plane coordinates based on a X,Y,Z generated system
- `Zones` zones are sub areas that exist in an area by an unknown or unique travel path, or when transition you from one scale to another.

## Room Properties

### General

- `Name` The room short name, displayed at the top of the room properties
- `Background` a custom background color, supports standard hex, rgb, and rgba css formatting and color words, for example: #FF0000, rgb(255,0,0), rgba(255,0,0,255), red are all the same color and valid formats

- `Z` The room's z coordinate
- `Zone` The room's zone, generated based on how entered
- `Area` The area the room is part of

## Known Issues

- `Blurred or spacing between rooms` this is mostly caused by different zoom levels due to how the mapper handles anti alias rooms map blur or shift just a minor 0.5 pixel to throw it off just a tad, it mostly happens in zoom levels that are not 25% intervals
- `Laggy map` when speed walking or moving quickly the map may lag or slow, you can attempt to mitigate this by using [Load in memory](preferences.md#mapper) preference, compacting the map, or reloading the client
- `Jumpy rooms or rooms in weird locations/only room displayed` This is mostly caused by the mapper losing track of internal coordinates or a non-standard exit, this is caused by multiple start locations when using multiple characters.
  - `The most common causes`
    - `Multiple characters` Each new start location is started as internal coordinates of 0,0,0 as it is a new "room" and does not know how it links to original map.
    - `Teleportation` When teleported to new locations may cause mapping coordinates to be thrown off.
    - `Portals` Magical or other portals that link two areas together as it will attempt to build coordinates off source room and since no standard it will generate a new zone and set the rooms x,y,z to source rooms coordinates
    - `Removing a room` will cause the coordinates to be lost and unless you go back to an already mapped room it will start over at 0,0,0 and possibly a new zone and will throw off mapper
  - `Possible fixes`:
    - Map as one character as much as you can to try and avoid as much jumping as possible
    - Manually edit each room's x,y,z,zone coordinates align them up to the previous mapped section
    - Move to a known good room then remove the poorly mapped room or rooms and remap beginning from the good room so that the rooms will be generated with proper generated coordinates.
- `Mapper not loading` Possible corrupted map or error with mapper. You can determine the issue by loading jiMUD with the `--debug` command line argument to force the mapper developer tools to be opened and display any errors in the console.
- `Mapper not saving` check folder permissions and ensure the data folder exist
- `Auto walk out of order directions` Auto walk can sometimes get its directions out of order if computer is slow processing, fix by increasing the [Delay between directions](preferences.md#mapper) time until the problem is limited or disappears.
- `Slow performance` Make sure you are not using --disable-gpu, with out the gpu it can cause the mapper to draw and perform slow

## Trouble shooting

- `Corrupted map` if you be leave your map has been corrupted the only fix is to delete it and start over either from exported data, backed up data file, or from online backup. Map data file is located at:
  - `%APPDATA%\jiMUD\map.sqlite` on Windows
  - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jiMUD/map.sqlite` or `~/.config/jiMUD/map.sqlite` on Linux
  - `~/Library/Application Support/jiMUD/map.sqlite` on macOS

**Note** if using a character from the manager see character setting for map file name and location
