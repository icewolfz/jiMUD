# jiMUD

A mud client using electron for [ShadowMUD](http://www.shadowmud.com) based on it's web client.

## Build

  To build jiMUD you must have node, npm, typescript 2.3+, cPython installed
  Steps to build:

### Prerequisites

Install or download Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  - Npm comes with most node installs, if not see: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
Install or download Typescript: https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/
  - easiest to just use npm globally

### Electrion builder:

Required modules or packages to build different installer types: https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build.html

### Clone repository or use archive zip

1. `git clone https://github.com/icewolfz/jiMUD.git` or `git pull` if already ready cloned, or you can download and unzip the source archive

### Windows

1. npm install - install all the node modules, **Note** you will need to rerun this only if modules have been updated in the package.json
1. npm run release:win - build installer and portable exe

### Linux

1. npm install - install all the node modules, **Note** you will need to rerun this only if modules have been updated in the package.json
1. npm run release:linux - build tar, deb, appImage, and rpm packages

### Mac

1. npm install - install node modules, **Note** you will need to rerun this only if modules have been updated in the package.json
1. npm run release:mac - build Mac packages

Build and package files are all saved to dist folder

## Run

1. npm install - install node modules
1. npm run rebuild - this rebuilds modules to work with electron if needed
1. npm run compile - compile typescript into javascript files
1. npm run start - start jiMUD

This will allow you to run jiMUD directly from this folder with out the need to
package into a self contained folder or building an installer.

**Note** you only need to run the install, rebuild, and compile steps the first 
time or any time you update the packages.

## Standalone application

1. npm install - install node modules
1. npm run build:debug-compile

This will compile typescript into javascript, rebuild native node modules and create
a runnable package that can be ran from dist/ARCH-unpacked folder. This can be used
for debugging or running it as full app with out the need to install, just run
the jiMUD executable in dist/ARCH-unpacked folder.

## Known Issues

- Linux:
  - Tray icon: When app indicator is used on Linux, the click event is ignored, see [Electron docs for more limits](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/tray)
  - Auto updating is only supported by Appimage
  - Show in task bar is no longer supported because Electron removed support due to wayland
- Display:
  - Unicode RTL text selection display is not correct
  - MXP Image height is limited to line height
  - MXP Image selection/copy not supported
- Backup:
  - Loading data that is related to operating system may revert to default or be ignored as paths could not exist or may be in wrong format
- Command input
  - Text selection may be lost when other controls are given focus
- Immortal tools
  - Dragging multiple files and dropping outside to other applications will only drop the first file, all others ignored. This is a limitation of electron drag and drop support, until it is added it can not be supported outside of application
- Advanced editor
  - Paste may lose some colors/background colors on pasted, this is a bug in TinyMCE editor
  - When applying styles to all text some styles may get stuck
  - Some styles will not flash when flashing is enabled depending on order of styles applied
  - Reverse style has weird results with heavy nesting of reverse tags and colors, suggest to just use normal background colors.
  - Correction from context menu may remove applied styles depending on if they are just that word
  - Complex color codes may be returned due to nesting and other complex style choices
- Mail composer
  - All issues from Advanced editor
  - Does not work if in an editor on mud or at a prompt accepting input
- General slow performance, do not use --disable-gpu it can impact overall performance
