Nightmare IV SimulEfun: add_sky_event()

void add_sky_event(function);

DESCRIPTION
Sets a function to be called whenever the time of day changes.
It will call the function with the new time of day as an
argument.

EXAMPLES
add_sky_event( (: this_object(), "howl" :) );
will set up so that this_object()->howl() gets called every change in
the time of day.  So, when night falls, it calls:
this_object()->howl("night");
You can test the string passed to see what time of day it is and act
accordingly.

NOTE
Object which use this SimulEfun *in general* should call it from create().
In addition, objects which have the functions being called (i.e. the object
with howl() in it) should have set_no_clean(1); called.
