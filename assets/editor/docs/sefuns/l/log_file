Nightmare Mudlib 3.2 SimulEfun: log_file()

void log_file(string, mixed, int);

DESCRIPTION
The first argument is the name of a file under the MUD's log directory
as defined in /adm/include/dirs.h.  The text which is the second argument
is written to that file.  The third argument is option and determines how many
old log files to keep before removing, names will be in the format of file.old.#. 
Using this SimulEfun is subject to the MUD's security for the log directory in 
question.  In other words, secure log directories require logging objects to 
have an euid represented by the define in security.h UID_LOG or UID_ROOT.  
Any object may log to non-secure log directories (like the reports directory).

EXAMPLE
log_file("enter", (string)this_player()->query_name()+" (quit): "+
  ctime(time()));
This will log to the file /log/enter (assuming /log is the log dir) the text
of the second argument.
