Nightmare IV SimulEfun: member_group()

int member_group(string, string|string *);

DESCRIPTION
First argument is an euid (often the name of a creator) and the second
argument is either a group from /adm/db/groups.db (also defined in
/adm/include/security.h), or an array of groups.  This efun
will return true if the euid is a member of one of the groups.

EXAMPLES
member_group("descartes", "superuser") returns 1 (at least on Nightmare :))
member_group("hacker", ({ "arch", "superuser" })) should return 0 if security 
    is right!
