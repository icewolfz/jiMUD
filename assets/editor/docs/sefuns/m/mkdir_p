int mkdir_p(string directory)

Like "mkdir -p" in linux. If the dir already exists then it will not be
created. If it does not exist then it will create as many directory components
as it needs. Thus:
   mkdir /realms/ideysus/something/somethingelse
works, even if /realms/ideysus/something/ does not exist.
