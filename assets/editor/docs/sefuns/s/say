Nightmare IV SimulEfun: say()

varargs string say(mixed, mixed);

DESCRIPTION
First argument is a message that should be displayed to everyone in the
environment of the command giver (this_player()).  The second argument
is an object or an array of objects which are excluded from seeing the
message.  The command giver is automatically excluded.
The second argument is optional.

EXAMPLE
say("Foo.") will display "Foo" to everyone in the room except the person who
   is currently this_player()
say("Descartes hits Forlock in the nose.", ({find_player("forlock")}))
   displays the text to everyone but Descartes and Forlock.

NOTE
This SimulEfun takes place of the MudOS efun by the same name in order to
use message() for proper formatting using ansi, terminal wrapping, etc.
Old code using say() will work fine under this SimulEfun.
