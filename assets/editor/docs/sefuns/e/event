Nightmare IV SimulEfun: event()

void event(string, int, mixed *, int);

DESCRIPTION
Sets up and event to occur at a much later time.
This SimulEfun is much like the efun call_out(), except
that event() saves across reboot.  This is very useful for setting up
an events which is to accur once a month or even longer.
The first argument is the name of the function to be called when the
time comes.  The second argument is how many seconds from the time
event() us called should pass before the function gets called.  The
remaining arguments are optional.  The third one is an array of
arguments which will get passed to the function.  The final argument
will set up the event to be recurring, so that once the event happens,
it is automatically set up to happen again after the same original
interval.  1 means recurr, 0 meansone time only.

EXAMPLES
event("start_war", MONTH) will call start_war() in this_object() one
   mud month from now
