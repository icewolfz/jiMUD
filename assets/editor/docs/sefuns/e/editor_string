void editor_string(function f)

A helper function to allow one to simply get a string from a user 
via the editor with no need to mess around with temporary files, etc.

When called this_player() is placed into an editor. When the player 
exits the editor 'f' is called with a single parameter (either the 
string they typed or undefined() if they exited).
