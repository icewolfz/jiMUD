Nightmare Mudlib 3.2 simul_efun: percent()

float percent(int|float, int|float);

DESCRIPTION
An efun which returns what percent of denominator numerator is.
Either value may be either float or int, and mixing is ok.

EXAMPLES
Goal: to find out what percent x is of y (say x=12, y=100);
z = percent(x, y); /* this would be the call */
the value of z then becomes 12.00 (notice it is a float)

Example 2:
Goal to get an int percentage value for (x=12.00, y=100) (float, int)
int z;
z = to_int(precent(x, y));
the value of z then becomes 12 (an int)

DESCRIPTION
to_int(), to_float()
