varargs string render_columns(mixed* data, string* titles,
   string top_border_colour, string body_border_colour, int screen)

Renders data into a series of columns. The first argument is an array of rows,
where each row is an array of strings/integers (both of which align correctly)

If the titles argument is non zero then it will be used as a header for
each column (array of strings only).

All the arrays in data and titles(if it is passed) must be the same size.

If top_border_colour is non zero then a border will be drawn using
top_border_colour as a colour. Similarly body_border_colour can be used to
draw a border around data.

screen is the maximum width that will be used.
