Nightmare IV SimulEfun: creator_file()

string creator_file(string)

DESCRIPTION
Returns a uid for the creator of an object based upon its file name.
Except for backbone objects, this uid will become the object's uid.
In the case of backbone objects, they get the uid of the object which
created them if your mud config file requests them to do so.
