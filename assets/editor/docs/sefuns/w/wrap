varargs string wrap(string str, int width, mixed indent)

Wraps str so each line is less than width in length. This is done by inserting 
newlines. wrap is aware of colour codes and will not insert newlines into them 
in a valid colour encoded string.

If indent is passed it is prefixed to wrapped lines (after the first line)
If indent is an integer it shall be considered a number of spaces.
