Nightmare IV SimulEfun: distinct_array()

mixed *distinct_array(mixed *);

DESCRIPTION
Takes any sort of array and returns a similar array with all duplicate
members removed from the array so that each member occurrs only once
in the array.

EXAMPLES:
distinct_array( ({ "a", "b", "c", "a" })) returns ({"a", "b", "c"})

NOTE
This is the same as the Nightmare Mudlib 3.* SimulEfun uniq_array()
but was renamed due to confusion with the MudOS efun unique_array().
