Nightmare mudlib living lfun: query_reference()

string query_reference(string limb)

If there is a limb named "limb", then this function returns the "reference" 
limb.  The reference limb is another limb that should be lost when this one
is lost.  The reference limb, in turn, may also have a reference limb.  If
FATAL is returned, then losing this limb should result in loss of life.
