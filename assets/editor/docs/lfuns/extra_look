Nightmare mudlib lfun: extra_look()

string extra_look();

This function is called from the long of a living object carrying the object
this function is in.  For instance, a wedding ring has the line:

string extra_look() { return capitalize(owner)+" is married to "+
	capitalize(spouse)+"\n"; }

When another player looks at me, and I am carrying this ring, the line
"Descartes is married to Ariana" is added to my description.
