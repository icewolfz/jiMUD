Nightmare mudlib efun: remove()

void remove();

No objects should ever be destroyed by the efun destruct() as was the practice
in the LPMud series mudlibs.  Instead each object should have a function in
it called remove() which takes care of any messy business left over before
getting rid of the object.  A good example is making sure that any object
carrying an item deducts its weight from the player carring it before
destructs so that the player's carry is correct.

This function is defined for any object already in the mudlib.  So if
you are inheriting a mudlib object, like Object.c, weapon.c, armour.c
etc... you do not need to worry about writing this function.
