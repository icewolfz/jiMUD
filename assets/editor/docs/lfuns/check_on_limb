Nightmare mudlib living lfun: check_on_limb()

int check_on_limb(string limb)

This function is called in combat to check on the status of each limb.  If
the limb has reached it's maximum damage, then the proper messages are
delivered by this function and corpse and/or body parts are cloned up and
moved the current location.  Wizards should probably not need to ever call
this function.
