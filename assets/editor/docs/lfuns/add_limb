Nightmare mudlib living lfun: add_limb()

varargs int add_limb(string limb_name, string limb_ref, int max_dam, int curr_dam, int limb_ac, int dam_ref)

This adds a new limb to a living object.  "limb_name" is the name of the 
limb being added.  "limb_ref" is the name of another limb that should be lost
when this limb is lost, or FATAL if losing it is fatal, or "" if nothing else
should happen.  "max_dam" is the maximum damage that the limb can sustain 
before being lost.  "curr_dam" is how much damage has been done to the limb so
far (allows for creation of wounded monsters).  "limb_ac" is how much 
protection the limb has (>0 means natural armour).  "dam_ref" is the exact 
maximum amount of hp for a limb, if not set defaults to query_max_hp() / max_dam

%^BOLD%^Each limb that you add must have it's own distinct name. %^RESET%^
