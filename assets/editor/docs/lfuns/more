Nightmare Mudlib player lfun: more()

varargs in more(mixed what, string cl, function endfun);

This lfun will more a file or an array of lines for a player.  The
first argument is the only required argument.  It is the name of the
file to be paged through, or an array of lines which will be paged through.
The second argument, which is optional, specifies what class of message
the paged information belongs to.  The default is "info".
The final argument is a function to be called when the player is done
paging through the file.

Examples:
this_player()->more("/std/user.c");
this_player()->more("/doc/help/topics", "help");
this_player()->more(str_array, "info", (: this_object(), "end_more" :));

Number 1 simply pages through the file "/std/user.c"
Number 2 pages through the topics help file, giving it the "help" message
    class.
Number 3 pages through an array of lines (like the who command), giving
    it the message class "info", and asking it to call the function
    end_more() in the object that made the more() call.
