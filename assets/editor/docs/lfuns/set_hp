Nightmare mudlib living lfun: set_hp()

void set_hp(int hp)

Basically, this sets the hit points of a living object to "hp".  There are a 
few side effects in certain cases.  If "max_hp" is 0 then this sets the
maximum hit points to "hp" also.  If "hp" is greater than "max_hp" and the
living object is a player, then "hp" is set to "max_hp".  If "hp" is greater
than "max_hp" and the living object is not a player, then the hit points
and the maximum hit points are both set to "hp".
