Nightmare mudlib living lfun: set_mp()

void set_mp(int mp)

Basically, this sets the magic points of a living object to "mp".  There are a 
few side effects in certain cases.  If "max_mp" is 0 then this sets the
maximum magic points to "mp" also.  If "mp" is greater than "max_mp" and the
living object is a player, then "mp" is set to "max_mp".  If "mp" is greater
than "max_mp" and the living object is not a player, then the magic points
and the maximum magic points are both set to "mp".  "mp" values of less than
0 get set to 0.
