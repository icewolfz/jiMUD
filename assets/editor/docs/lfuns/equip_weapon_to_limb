Nightmare mudlib living lfun: equip_weapon_to_limb()

string equip_weapon_to_limb(object weap, string limb1, string limb2)

This tries to equip "weap" to "limb1" and/or "limb2".  It returns an
appropriate message to be sent to the player if the equip fails.  If it
succeeds, it returns a 0 and equips the weapon properly.  If "weap" is a
one handed weapon, then "limb2" should be passed as a 0.  This is used
already in weapon.c so most wizards probably will never have to use this
function.
